# Book I: LibreAssistant

Open. Tolerant. Yours.

## Introduction
LibreAssistant is an end user product that frames the large language model as the engine, the application as the body, and plug-ins as optional upgrades. Choose an engine, add options from the catalogue, and orchestrate everything through the switchboard for a transparent, user-controlled experience.
